                <h2>Our certificate and online programs for 2021</h2>
                <p>For the class of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic delineated and revamped their last year of college. At
                    the end of March, campus closures capsized students’ college lives, compelling them to wind up their
                    final year virtually. And now, students and their families are dealing with the reality of virtual
                    graduations standing in lieu of the traditional in-person ceremonies.
                    <br>
                    The ceremony kicked off with the lighting of the lamp by the host, Dr. A.P. Krishna, Registrar BIT
                    Mesra.
                    After several months of contemplation, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra ultimately organised the
                    30th convocation ceremony on 12th December, 2020 from 11:00 AM. It was reflective of the ground
                    realities during the coronavirus pandemic as the event was colonised through a digital platform,
                    Youtube Livestream, for awarding degrees to the Doctoral, Post-Graduate, Undergraduate, and Diploma
                    Students graduating this year. Instead of joining a procession in caps and gowns and publicly
                    receiving their degrees, the graduating batch of 2019 logged in to the ceremony from home. The
                    occasion was graced by the presence of Smt. Droupadi Murmu, Hon’ble Governor of Jharkhand and
                    Chancellor of the institute. Among the important dignitaries attending the event were Dr. Vijay
                    Kumar Saraswat, Padma Bhushan recipient, also a member of NITI Aayog, as the Chief Guest for the
                    ceremony, and Shri C.K. Birla, Chairman, Board of Governors, BIT Mesra as the Guest of Honour
